# PayApp
Calculate Table of compensation pre & post taxes.

Example of program that uses:
structs, cin, cout, function calls, pointers, object-oriented, private & public fields, using string input in If statement.
Main contains comments to follow along and understand flow.

Note that once tax data is calculated it overrides pre tax information. If this program develops and both data is needed
you will need to create a different class to keep both data records. 
This is a good challnege for new programmers.
